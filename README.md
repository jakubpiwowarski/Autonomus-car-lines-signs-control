# Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Projects Repository for Highly Automated Vehicles

## Repository Description

This repository contains a set of projects related to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), specifically designed for highly automated vehicles. It encompasses various aspects of ADAS technology, including road line detection, object classification (road signs) using CNN, and end-to-end behavioral cloning involving both regression and classification on the same data.

### Projects in the Repository

1. **Road Line Detection**: This project focuses on identifying and tracking road lines on the road. Image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques are used to detect both double and single road lines on the road. The results of this project can be utilized in systems that keep the vehicle within the lane.

2. **Object Classification (Road Signs) Using CNN**: This project centers on object classification on the road, particularly road signs. It employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify various signs, such as speed limit signs, stop signs, warning signs, and more. This is crucial for alerting the driver to road conditions.

3. **End-to-End Behavioral Cloning**: This project focuses on cloning driver behaviors in an ADAS environment. It employs an end-to-end approach, meaning machine learning involves both regression, which predicts the vehicle's motion, and classification, which determines what actions to take in a given road scenario. This is a key component of driver assistance systems that react to surrounding traffic.

These projects constitute valuable contributions to the development of advanced driver assistance systems, which are essential for highly automated vehicles. They are based on advanced machine learning technologies, computer vision, and image processing algorithms, with the aim of enhancing safety and driving comfort. All projects in this repository are publicly available, allowing other researchers, developers, and engineers to leverage these achievements for further advancements in ADAS technology.
