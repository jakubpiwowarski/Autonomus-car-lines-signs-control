# Autonomous Vehicle Project End to End


## Project Description
Welcome to the project focused on autonomous vehicle navigation based on advanced camera image analysis and the application of deep neural networks. The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive system that enables a vehicle to navigate autonomously on roads, responding to changing traffic conditions while maintaining a high level of automation.

## Project Objectives
* Motion and Road Element Detection: The project involves an elaborate analysis of camera images to detect the motion of other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Furthermore, the system will be capable of identifying road lines, objects on the path, traffic lights, and road signs.

* End-to-End Control: The approach used is end-to-end, where a sophisticated deep neural network model is responsible for making driving decisions. This model will analyze camera images and surrounding information to make appropriate actions such as acceleration, braking, lane changing, etc.

* High-Level Automation: The primary goal of the project is to achieve a high level of automation in vehicle navigation. Through the training and optimization of deep neural network models and the implementation of an end-to-end control algorithm, we aim to minimize human driver intervention.

* Behavioral Cloning and Simulations: To refine the system and test it under diverse traffic conditions, behavioral cloning techniques will be utilized. This will enable us to simulate the vehicle's behavior in various road scenarios, providing us with a better understanding of the system's functioning and potential improvements.
